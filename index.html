                        <p class="popup-p1-4">For almost 40 years, EFG Hermes has helped its clients and the communities where it operates adapt to the changing world and benefit from new technologies and opportunities. Today, we stand at the cusp of a new transformation. After two years of COVID-19-related uncertainty, humanity faces yet more instability. The challenges that face us today are in many ways unparalleled and daunting – from climate change and natural disasters to rising inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, and the war in Ukraine. In many ways, it feels like a perfect storm, however, it is also true that the tools we have at our disposal today are exceptional.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-4">The transition needed to address the risks of climate change requires a profound commitment that goes beyond lip service from people at all levels, but it falls to financial institutions such as ours to identify the opportunities for impactful investment and intervention. The scale of investment required is immense, and it is imperative that we not waste scarce financial resources on projects of limited long-term benefit. At EFG Hermes, we pride ourselves on our ability to navigate stormy economic climates by identifying not just the risks but more importantly, the opportunities. At the same time, we understand the impact of the decisions we make. Our community-level work has made us uniquely aware of just how important the social aspect of sustainability is. The integrated development work undertaken in rural areas by our Foundation for Social Development has provided us with real-world understanding of the impact of the climate crisis and economic stagnation on individuals. Developing resilient systems is critical, and investment is the key to change. It must be the right investment, however. We not only possess the experience to make those calls, but our scope provides us with the ability to approach challenges simultaneously from different aspects.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-4">Our commitment to clean energy is a prime example of the synergy we offer. On the Private Equity side, Vortex Energy, our award-winning renewable energy investment platform has a global mandate to invest in clean energy opportunities on behalf of sovereign, institutional, and strategic investors and maintains a firm commitment to clean energy and sustainable finance. Meanwhile, Corp-Solutions, one of our flagship Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) companies is providing financing mechanisms for renewable energy projects in the agricultural sector, and valU, our award-winning buy-now pay-later (BNPL) platform is helping customers finance solar panels. At the community level, the Foundation is helping migrate 100 schools in Egypt to clean renewable energy. It is this level of multi-faceted commitment to critical issues that will allow us to contribute meaningfully to ensuring the planet is healthy for generations to come.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-4">As always, I thank you for your continued support, and I humbly present you with EFG Hermes’ 2022 Sustainability Report.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-4">Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p class="popup-p1-2">EFG Hermes’ purpose is to use the power of finance to unleash potential and create sustainable progress today and for generations to come. As a universal bank with strong local roots in Egypt and significant presence in 13 other countries, many of which are frontier emerging markets (FEMs), we are ideally placed to help our customers build a solid financial foundation by offering exceptional advisory and investment services and financial products supported by some of the most innovative digital solutions on the market. This also means we are in a strong position to make marked progress on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the exceptional tools, resources, and capacity for innovation we have at our disposal.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-2">In 2022, climate issues remained at the forefront of global sustainability issues, particularly in light of the COP27 Climate Change Conference held in November in Sharm El Sheikh. As signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) since 2018, EFG Hermes is at the forefront of efforts to champion responsible investment in Frontier Emerging Markets (FEM), particularly when it comes to climate change and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our approach is to focus on clean energy, both in terms of financing and in terms of deployment. Vortex Energy, our ground-breaking renewable energy investment platform, has been a pioneer in financing the transition to clean energy. Since inception, Vortex Energy has deployed, managed, and harvested capital across three fund vehicles, focusing on efficient portfolio management and maximizing its environmental and social impact.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-2">Elsewhere, our investment portfolio also addresses the fulfilment of other SDGs. Strategic investment in socially critical sectors such as health, education, and pharmaceuticals underscore our commitment to impactful investment. Our investment in education has been particularly significant in 2022 and includes the use of several mechanisms. Our Private Equity division continues to expand the Egypt Education Platform and recently acquired Selah El Telmeez, Egypt’s premier provider of educational content, in partnership with the Sovereign Fund of Egypt. Our Investment Banking arm successfully concluded the advisory for CIRA Education’s securitization bond offering. On the NBFI front, Corp-Solutions continues to dedicate a significant portion of its portfolio to education-related financing, and valU provides clients with instalment plans that give access to better educational opportunities. At the community level, the EFG Hermes Foundation for Sustainable Development continues its work on pre-school education and teacher training in Upper Egypt as part of its signature integrated development work and is scaling up its introduction of clean energy for schools both for environmental reasons and to mitigate rising energy costs and free up scarce resources for reinvestment in improved educational offerings.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-2">Our non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) continue to grow from strength to strength, greatly expanding the products we offer, particularly when it comes to supporting and empowering the micro-finance and start-up sectors. Our flagship NBFI brands such as Tanmeyah, PayTabs, valU, and Corp-Solutions provide access to financing and tools that foster financial inclusion and are continuously redefining the market by offering innovative, sustainable solutions to a wide range of clients.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-2">We also continue to improve our reporting and disclosure procedure and to update our policy environment, expanding our ESG policy this year to address our growing NBFI platform and updating our audit and compliance procedures accordingly. In 2022Q1, we also submitted our fourth transparency report as part of our commitment to the UN PRI and renewed our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-2">I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the EFG Hermes team, and particularly the CSR department, for their dedication and commitment to helping us identify opportunities and fulfill our sustainability commitments. I would also like to thank our stakeholders, partners and clients for their faith and support.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-2">The task we face over the coming decades will be to raise enough capital for the investments required to tackle the challenges that face our world. I believe that EFG Hermes possesses the tools and the experience to ensure that this capital is used constructively and allocated towards projects and activities that are socially and environmentally sustainable as well as commercially viable.As CEO, I am committed to delivering on this promise.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-2">I thank you for your time and herewith present our progress in this, our ninth annual Sustainability Report.</p>
                        <p class="popup-p1-2">Sincerely yours,</p>

Thankfully, the goal has never been more clear: 1.5 degrees centigrade (“1.5°C”). Estimated by a consensus of climate scientists and further agreed by global leaders under the Paris Agreement of 2015, 1.5°C is the preferred maximum temperature rise that can be tolerated if we are to protect ourselves from the greatest consequences of climate change.</p>
                          <p class="paragraph-6">To limit the rise of global temperature to less than 1.5°C, we must reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by at least 80% before 2050, but the commitment is now. Furthermore, unless we reduce GHG emissions by at least 50% before 2030, the probability of achieving the 2050 goal is exceedingly unlikely.</p>

Although the situation continues to unfold with no immediate end in sight, energy security has become ever more important for countries and societies to have access to electricity and avoid energy rationing or blackouts in the upcoming winters.</p>
                          <p class="paragraph-6">The public and private sectors have shown tremendous determination to come together to support the energy transition to sustainable alternatives at a faster pace than ever before. Large-scale investment to transform the global energy sector and transition to a low-carbon society is crucial both for security of supply and the climate. For Vortex Energy, this is a call to action and an opportunity for continued leadership. Vortex Energy continues to honour its responsibilities as a global citizen, and its platform demonstrates that its present commitment is unwavering. Importantly, Vortex Energy’s integrated investment platform supports the construction of sustainable infrastructure and the advancement of efficient technologies required to secure our energy future.</p>

                          <p class="paragraph-6">Since inception and up to 2020, Vortex Energy acquired operational renewable energy generation plants (wind and solar) in continental Europe. Vortex Energy accumulated 822MW of net capacity attributable to its stakes on individual assets across Spain, Portugal, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom. Over their respective holding periods the assets operation was optimised for maximum clean energy generation and were aligned to the latest best industry practices to prolong their expected lifetimes. Vortex Energy delivered 4.6 terawatt hours (“TWh”) of clean energy, which displaced approximately 4.5Mn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (“MTCO2e”). The assets seeded by Vortex Energy continue to operate today and for the next few decades will continue to save 1.5Mn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (“MTCO2e”) per year.</p>
                          <p class="paragraph-6">In July 2021, Vortex Energy launched its fourth investment vehicle and flagship fund “Vortex IV”, that reached first close shortly after, anchored by EFG Hermes, Abu Dhabi sovereign institutional investors and family offices among others. For Vortex Energy, this milestone marked the formalization of a new global investment strategy and alignment with its investors about the importance of the energy transition currently underway.</p>

                          <p class="paragraph-6">The risks of investing in this theme are general such as economic recession, inflation and higher interest rates, however companies included are generally more inclusive than others.</p>

                          </div>
                          <p class="paragraph-6">ESG friendly companies are companies that seek to address and manage their environmental, social and governance risks. Such companies seek among other things ,to reduce their environmental risk, aim to benefit society as a whole and have strong ethics and governance. There are 20 companies included in this theme, all rated among companies with the lowest ESG risk rating. Only companies with a market cap larger than USD 10Bn. have been considered. The risk ratings measure the degree to which a company’s economic value is at risk driven by ESG factors or, more technically speaking, the magnitude of a company’s unmanaged risks within ESG.</p>
                          <p class="paragraph-6">Investing in ESG stocks has the same risk factors as investing generally in global equities. Higher interest rates could cause equity valuations to fall and our ESG list is valued at a13% premium measured on 12-month forward P/E to global equities so in theory these ESG stocks are slightly more sensitive to interest rates. A general slowdown in the global economy would also hit these ESG stocks as growth outlook decreases.</p>

                          <p class="paragraph-6">The use of renewable energy sources has many potential advantages such as diversification of the energy supply, reduced dependence on fossil fuels and reduced greenhouse gase missions. The companies included in this theme are those whose primary revenue is from the production of renewable energy such as solar power, wind, hydropower, biomass and geothermal energy.</p>
                          <p class="paragraph-6">The theme includes the companies with the biggest market cap but some smaller companies are also included if they have pure exposure to just a single energy source(such as revenue just from wind power). Also, some smaller companies have been given preference if they expanded the geographical span of the theme.</p>
                          <p class="paragraph-6">The risks associated here are the general risk of an economic recession, inflation and higher interest rates. Changes in climate and weather have an impact on the production of renewable energy to a larger degree than on fossil fuels.</p>

                          <p class="paragraph-6">Given current geopolitical factors, we believe that environmental advocacy will be prioritized over economic growth in the coming decades. This will in turn trigger massive government support and investments, which will create a megatrend for investment in green industries.</p>
                          <p class="paragraph-6">The green transformation theme comprises investments with companies in green in dustries, such as electric vehicles and chargers, carbon-neutral packaging, recycling, sustainable farming, green food and carbon capture technology. Renewable energy companies are in a separate theme, although they do play an important role in the Green transformation.</p>
                          <p class="paragraph-6">While the green transformation theme has been successful for investors, it doesn’t come without risk. This trend has no lack of staying power or signs of vanishing political capital; instead, the risks come from the largely high equity valuations, which have been steep when compared to the global equity market.</p>

As part of the Foundation’s flagship Naga‘ El Fawal and El Deir Village Project, the team redesigned the community centre to be completely powered by clean energy through a solar PV grid installed on its roof, providing reliable access to low-cost, clean energy. The success of this initiative led the Foundation to explore scaling up the project. The partnership with the Haya Karima initiative, established in 2021, provided the ideal opportunity and led to the current partnership agreement.</p>

Rapidly developing regulatory requirements and voluntary commitments are driving the commercial importance of sustainability and fuelling the call for stringent governance as we continue to build our position and capabilities as a sustainability leader in financial services. Our robust governance framework has helped us manage risk and achieve efficient growth and financial stability even as we continue our expansion into new geographies and launch a new roster of products and services.</p>
                          <p class="paragraph-11">Our Auditing, Compliance, Risk and Human Resource (HR) Departments consistently monitor our operations to ensure adherence to the regulatory requirements of the markets where we operate and the integration of new policies and benchmarks that ensure regulatory compliance, both relating to ESG and to our core business. In2022, almost 1,000 employees attended ESG-related training at EFG Hermes further consolidating the importance of sustainability within our culture.</p>

Although the situation continues to unfold with no immediate end in sight, energy security has become ever more important for countries and societies to have access to electricity and avoid energy rationing or blackouts in the upcoming winters.</p>
                                          <p class="paragraph-6">The public and private sectors have shown tremendous determination to come together to support the energy transition to sustainable alternatives at a faster pace than ever before. Large-scale investment to transform the global energy sector and transition to a low-carbon society is crucial both for security of supply and the climate. For Vortex Energy, this is a call to action and an opportunity for continued leadership. Vortex Energy continues to honour its responsibilities as a global citizen, and its platform demonstrates that its present commitment is unwavering. Importantly, Vortex Energy’s integrated investment platform supports the construction of sustainable infrastructure and the advancement of efficient technologies required to secure our energy future.</p>

                                          <p class="paragraph-6">Since inception, Vortex Energy has deployed, managed, and harvested capital across four fund vehicles, focusing on efficient portfolio management and maximizing its environmental and social impact.</p>
                                          <p class="paragraph-6">Since inception and up to 2020, Vortex Energy acquired operational renewable energy generation plants (wind and solar) in continental Europe. Vortex Energy accumulated 822MW of net capacity attributable to its stakes on individual assets across Spain, Portugal, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom. Over their respective holding periods the assets operation was optimised for maximum clean energy generation and were aligned to the latest best industry practices to prolong their expected lifetimes. Vortex Energy delivered 4.6 terawatt hours (“TWh”) of clean energy, which displaced approximately 4.5Mn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (“MTCO2e”). The assets seeded by Vortex Energy continue to operate today and for the next few decades will continue to save 1.5Mn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (“MTCO2e”) per year.</p>
                                          <p class="paragraph-6">In July 2021, Vortex Energy launched its fourth investment vehicle and flagship fund “Vortex IV”, that reached first close shortly after, anchored by EFG Hermes, Abu Dhabi sovereign institutional investors and family offices among others. For Vortex Energy, this milestone marked the formalization of a new global investment strategy and alignment with its investors about the importance of the energy transition currently underway.</p>

Through the transaction, Vortex IV will inject over EUR 475Mn into Ignis via a series of capital injections in order to fund its high growth plans for a &gt;20 GW platform and transform it into a fully integrated renewable IPP in Spain and other geographies.

This translates into risk for investors ifcompanies struggle to make strides in inclusivity.</p>
                                          <p class="paragraph-6">The “Women in Leadership” theme was created with companies from the three regions:North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific (developed markets) with a market cap largerthan USD 5Bn. The companies all have a larger percentage of women in executiveleadership positions relative to other companies within their respective regions.</p>
                                          <p class="paragraph-6">The risks of investing in this theme are general such as economic recession, inflation andhigher interest rates, however companies included are generally more inclusive thanothers.</p>

Such companies seek among other things,to reduce their environmental risk, aim to benefit society as a whole and have strongethics and governance. There are 20 companies included in this theme, all rated amongcompanies with the lowest ESG risk rating. Only companies with a market cap largerthan USD 10Bn. have been considered. The risk ratings measure the degree to which acompany’s economic value is at risk driven by ESG factors or, more technically speaking,the magnitude of a company’s unmanaged risks within ESG.</p>
                                          <p class="paragraph-6">Investing in ESG stocks has the same risk factors as investing generally in global equities.Higher interest rates could cause equity valuations to fall and our ESG list is valued at a13% premium measured on 12-month forward P/E to global equities so in theory theseESG stocks are slightly more sensitive to interest rates. A general slowdown in the globaleconomy would also hit these ESG stocks as growth outlook decreases</p>

The companies included in this theme are those whose primary revenueis from the production of renewable energy such as solar power, wind, hydropower,biomass and geothermal energy.</p>
                                          <p class="paragraph-6">The theme includes the companies with the biggest market cap but some smallercompanies are also included if they have pure exposure to just a single energy source(such as revenue just from wind power). Also, some smaller companies have been givenpreference if they expanded the geographical span of the theme.</p>
                                          <p class="paragraph-6">The risks associated here are the general risk of an economic recession, inflation andhigher interest rates.

                                          <p class="paragraph-6">The green transformation theme comprises investments with companies in greenindustries, such as electric vehicles and chargers, carbon-neutral packaging, recycling,sustainable farming, green food and carbon capture technology. Renewable energycompanies are in a separate theme, although they do play an important role in thegreen transformation.</p>
                                          <p class="paragraph-6">While the green transformation theme has been successful for investors, it doesn’tcome without risk. This trend has no lack of staying power or signs of vanishing politicalcapital; instead, the risks come from the largely high equity valuations, which have beensteep when compared to the global equity market.</p>

As part of the Foundation’s flagship Naga‘ El Fawal and El Deir Village Project, the team redesigned the community centre to be completely powered by clean energy through a solar PV grid installed on its roof, providing reliable access to low-cost, clean energy. The success of this initiative led the Foundation to explore scaling up the project. The partnership with the Haya Karima initiative, established in 2021, provided the ideal opportunity and led to the current partnership agreement.</p>
